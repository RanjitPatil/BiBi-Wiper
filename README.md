# BiBi-Windows-Wiper-Analysis

On 30th October, Security Joes posted its findings about a Wiper malware for Linux systems used in the war in Gaza. It was called the "BiBi-Linux Wiper". And then on November 1 2023, BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team found its Windows variant.

In this post, we will look at the Windows version of the BiBi Wiper known as the "BiBi-Windows Wiper"

## Malware Sample

> **MD5:** e26bba0304f14ef96beb60376791d32c

> **SHA256:** 40417e937cd244b2f928150cae6fa0eff5551fdb401ea072f6ecdda67a747e17

## Static Analysis

- The timestamp suggests the implant was compiled on Saturday, October 21, 2023, and it's a 64-bit one.

- Below are some intresting strings found in the binary file.

  ```

## Dynamic Analysis 

- Upon execution, the Wiper fetches the number of processors, calculates the threads accordingly using ```GetNativeSystemInfo()``` and prints the target directories and thread information on the console.

- It reads the hardcoded path: "C:\Users".

- Gets the currently available disk drives using ```GetLogicalDrives()``` where the return value is the bitmask, then it iterates through the A-Z (26) drives. It next does a bittest with the retrieved bitmask to determine the accessible drives on the system and appends ":\" to the drive name.

- Then for the available drives except the C drive it executes the ```GetDriveTypeA()``` which retrives the drive type, The BiBi-Windows Wiper here only targets the following drive types:

  DRIVE_FIXED
  
  DRIVE_REMOVABLE
  
  DRIVE_RAMDISK

- Further it creates a new thread which reads the commands stored in reverse, & then creates a new process using CreateProcessA to execute those commands. Following are the commands

    > ***`cmd.exe / c bcdedit / set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures`*** - Force the system to boot normally rather than into the Windows Recovery Environment

 -  Furthermore it creates another thread which executes of the Main Wiper routines. The Wiper routines perform the following actions.

 -  Arg1 - Path of the Directory to be destroyed (Could be provided by the Operator or retrieved as explained before)

 -  Arg2 - Number of threads

 -  Then it initiates an infinite loop where the counter is the Round "[+] Round %d\n" value - therefore once the Wiper is executed it would keep destroying the data infinitely

 -  Further based on the number of threads, it creates multiple threads in a loop which execute the main Wiper function.

 -  The BiBi-Windows wiper excludes the files with ".exe", ".dll" and ".sys" extension
